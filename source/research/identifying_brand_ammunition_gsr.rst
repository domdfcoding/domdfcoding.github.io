Identifying the Brand of Ammunition from Gunshot Residue
=============================================================

**Staffordshire University, 2018**

Abstract
----------

The analysis of gunshot residue (GSR) in forensic science can be used to
link suspects to crimes, and link multiple crimes together, as well as
providing police with intelligence. In the UK one of the most popular
calibres of ammunition for target shooting is .22 Long Rifle (.22 LR).
Limited research has been carried out to date on organic residues from
this calibre, with most research focusing on inorganic residues or on
other calibres more common in the USA and Europe. This research establishes
a complete approach for collecting, sampling and analysing propellant and
organic gunshot residue, and develops a bespoke, automatic interpretation
method to allow fired cartridge cases to be linked back to unfired
propellant through a database. The software was developed in Python and
is available as Open-Source Software.

Unfired propellant and spent cartridge cases from three brands of .22 LR
ammunition (Winchester “Pistol”, Eley “Contact”, and Geco “Rifle”) were
analysed using an established method of solid-phase microextraction (SPME),
gas chromatography (GC) and mass spectrometry (MS). SPME and GC-MS have
previously been shown to be effective for analysis of gunshot residue.
It has been possible to distinguish propellant and GSR samples from
different brands, and link samples from the same brand together, based
on the chromatograms and compounds identified by mass spectrometry.

The chemical compositions of the propellant and GSR from these brands
are outlined. Possible further optimisations for the method to improve
detection for different calibres of ammunition are also detailed.
